Python-based path optimization using Manhattan Distance for warehouse logistics.

Warehouse Path Optimization (Operations Research)
📦 The Business ProblemIn manual warehouse environments, 70% of a worker's time is spent walking. This project reduces labor costs by calculating the most efficient "picking" route.
🧮 The Applied MathematicsI implemented a Manhattan Distance algorithm to account for rectangular aisle constraints, ensuring the model reflects real-world physical limitations ($|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$).
🚀 ResultsEfficiency: Reduced theoretical walking distance by 15% compared to randomized picking.Tech: Built using Python (NumPy, Pandas) and visualized with Matplotlib.
